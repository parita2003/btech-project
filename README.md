# HR Interview Simulation System

A Python-based **HR Interview Simulation System** that evaluates candidates' responses based on **semantic similarity** and **confidence scoring** using audio input. This tool is designed to simulate HR interviews, providing real-time feedback on the quality and clarity of a user's answers to common HR questions.

## Introduction
The HR Interview Simulation System is an innovative project aimed at helping users prepare for HR interviews by simulating real-world scenarios. The system asks predefined HR questions, records the user's verbal responses, and evaluates them based on:
1. **Semantic Similarity**: How well the user's response aligns with predefined ideal answers.
2. **Confidence Score**: The clarity and confidence of the audio delivery.

This feedback empowers users to improve their communication and response quality.

---

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Converts audio responses to text using Google Speech Recognition.
- **Semantic Evaluation**: Compares the user's response to ideal answers using a Hugging Face model.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Uses audio properties like energy and zero-crossing rate for confidence measurement.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides immediate scores for similarity and confidence.

## Implementation

### 1. **Semantic Similarity**
   - Leverages the `SentenceTransformer` model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to calculate semantic similarity.
   - Predefined answers are embedded and compared with the user's response using cosine similarity.

### 2. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Audio analysis performed using `Librosa` to calculate:
     - **Energy**: Represents speech strength.
     - **Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)**: Measures clarity of speech.
   - These metrics are scaled dynamically to produce a confidence score.

### 3. **Speech Recognition**
   - Uses the `speech_recognition` library to record and transcribe audio responses.

---

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: The system presents predefined HR interview questions.
2. **Audio Input**: User answers verbally, which is recorded and transcribed.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Semantic similarity is calculated by comparing the user's response to predefined answers.
   - Confidence scoring is based on the audio's clarity and strength.
4. **Feedback**: The system provides similarity and confidence scores for each question.
5. **Summary**: A final summary of scores is presented to the user.
